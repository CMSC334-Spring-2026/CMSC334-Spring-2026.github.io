CMSC334-

When you are setting up your website, for deployment you need to go to the Pages tab under setting and 
make sure you are deploying from the main branch.  

You of course have to make sure all of the CMSC334- stuff has been changed as appropriate
(e.g., in the _config.yaml file). 

Also, it takes a minute for the change to kick in.  So you might get a 404 error at first.
