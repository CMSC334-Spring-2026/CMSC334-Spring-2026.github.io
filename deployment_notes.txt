CMSC334-

When you are setting up your website, for deployment you need to go to the Pages tab under setting and 
make sure you are deploying from the main branch.  

You of course have to make sure all of the CMSC334- stuff has been changed as appropriate
(e.g., in the _config.yaml file). 

You also have to make sure the repo visibility is public.  That doesn't allow others to
change it, but only to clone it.   To do this, use this:

To change a GitHub repository's visibility from private to public, 
you must navigate to the repository's Settings tab and use the "Change visibility" 
option found in the "Danger Zone" section

Also, it takes a minute for the change to kick in.  So you might get a 404 error at first.
